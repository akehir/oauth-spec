      <t>This specification defines two client instance extension parameters
      for OAuth 2.0 user authorization requests.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This extension to the <xref target="oauth2">OAuth 2</xref> protocol
      defines two additional parameters that a client can include in requests
      to the user authorization endpoint which can be used to identify an
      instance of a given client and distinguish it from other instances of
      the same client that a user may authorize. These are intended to aid in
      the user experience and to be used in addition to the client identifier
      as defined in <xref target="oauth2">OAuth 2</xref>. </t>

      <t>This extension is an adaptation of the Google-deployed <xref
      target="google_oauth">xoauth_display_name</xref> OAuth 1.0 extension
      parameter. </t>

      <section title="Multiple Copies of One Client">
        <t>A given client identifier may represent more than one access grant
        for a given user within a system protected by OAuth. For example, a
        user may authorize the same installed client on both a laptop and a
        desktop computer. Each of these would have the same client identifier
        but be issued different tokens and will have been granted access
        separately. This extension is intended to allow the two client
        instances to identify themselves to the authorization server in a way
        that the user could later differentiate which tokens belonged to which
        copy of the client.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proxied Client Access">
        <t>An OAuth client capable of using the web-server flow could allow
        the user to interact with it through another means such as email or
        SMS. In this case, the OAuth client is a single entity with a single
        client ID which in turn could have multiple distinct grants per user.
        For example, in an email-proxied system, a user could grant access to
        the email proxy using multiple separate email addresses. In each of
        these, the client is the proxy itself, but the grant is being made on
        behalf of a particular email account. This extension is intended to
        allow the proxy client to identify to the authorization server which
        address is being requested.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Dynamic, Anonymous, or Unregistered Clients">
        <t>An authorization server can allow unregistered or anonymous clients
        to access its protected resources. In these cases, the client
        credentials generally act as a user-agent string, providing a
        machine-identifiable string claimed by the client itself. This
        extension is intended to allow such clients to present identifying
        information to the end-user through the authorization endpoint. See
        the security considerations section for more information.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Parameters">
      <t hangText="instance_name"><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="instance_name"><vspace blankLines="0" />OPTIONAL A
          short, human-readable name that the server SHOULD display to the
          end-user along with the client name. </t>

          <t hangText="instance_description"><vspace blankLines="0" />OPTIONAL
          A longer, human-readable description that the server MAY display to
          the end-user along with the client name. If a client presents the
          instance_description, it MUST also present an instance_name.</t>
        </list>The server MUST NOT assume any format or structure to either of
      the parameters. </t>

      <t>If present, the authorization server SHOULD [MAY?] store this
      information along with its associated access grant in order to present
      it to the user at a future time. The authorization server MAY allow the
      end-user to edit or augment the client-presented information prior to
      storage. The authorization server MAY impose size limitations on either
      or both parameters, and such limitations SHOULD be documented as part of
      the the authorization server's API.</t>

      <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The instance_name and instance_description parameters MUST be treated
      as self-asserted information and MUST NOT be treated as a replacement
      for a client credential as defined in <xref target="oauth2">OAuth
      2</xref>. Instead, the instance parameters MUST be treated with a level
      of trust appropriate to the end client.</t>

      <t>When this information is displayed to the user, the authorization
      server MUST present it in such a way as to make clear to the end user
      that the instance information is self-asserted by the client and has not
      been validated. The authorization server MUST NOT display the instance
      information in lieu of a pre-registered display name, if available, but
      SHOULD display the instance information in addition to a pre-registered
      display name, if available. </t>
